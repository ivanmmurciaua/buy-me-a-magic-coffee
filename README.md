This is a personal project to understand how works https://magic.link to onboard web2 users into web3 application.

Currently live in:
> https://divine-resonance-5281.on.fleek.co/

Running in:
> Mumbai Testnet

## For Email login

If you want to add Mumbai $MATIC to your generated-wallet, just copy your generated-address clicking in **Magic Wallet** and paste it in **Wallet Address** field here: 
> https://faucet.polygon.technology/

Later, click on **Sumbit** and you'll get your Mumbai $MATIC soon.

This app will work in Polygon Mainnet and the **Buy** option in your **Magic Wallet** that allows you to buy real cryptocurrency with Moonpay platform, will make sense...

**Please understand, that if you buy $MATIC with Moonpay, you'll lose your fiat money or the funds just will go to Polygon Mainnet (not tested)**
